        Recruits IP Licensing Terms & Conditions
      </h1>
      <h4 className="pageCaption unboundedLight">Last updated: May 4, 2025</h4>
      <p>
        These Terms & Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of any “Recruits” NFT
        artwork and associated intellectual property (“IP”). By purchasing or
        otherwise acquiring a Recruits NFT, you agree to be bound by these
        Terms.
      </p>
      <h3 className="heading">1. Definitions</h3>
      <p>
        “Recruits” refers to the NFT collection and brand known as “Recruits.”
      </p>
      <p>“NFT Owner” means the current holder of a Recruits NFT.</p>
      <p>
        “Licensed IP” means only the specific artwork, likeness, coloring, and
        design elements tied to the individual Recruits NFT you own.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Team” refers to the creators, managers, and legal representatives of
        the Recruits Project.
      </p>
      <h3 className="heading">2. Ownership</h3>
      <p>
        All Recruits IP—including the project name, logo, slogans, trademarks,
        branding elements, and any other proprietary content—remains the sole
        and exclusive property of the Recruits Project at all times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Purchasing or holding a Recruits NFT does not transfer ownership of any
        underlying IP itself—only a limited license to use the Licensed IP, as
        described below.
      </p>
      <h3 className="heading">3. Scope of License</h3>
      <h4 className="subHeading">3.1 License Grant:</h4>
      <p>
        Subject to these Terms and your continued ownership of the NFT, the Team
        grants each NFT Owner a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free,
        revocable license to use, reproduce, display, and create derivative
        works of the Licensed IP (i.e., your NFT’s likeness) for personal,
        commercial, and promotional purposes, including but not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Profile images, avatars, and banners</li>
        <li>On‑demand merchandise (e.g., apparel, prints, accessories)</li>
        <li>Digital or physical art displays</li>
        <li>Artwork within broader creative projects</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 className="subHeading">3.2 Prohibited Uses</h4>
      <p>
        You may not use any Recruits IP other than your NFT’s likeness unless
        you obtain separate, written permission from the Team. In particular,
        you may not use:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The “Recruits” name or any variation thereof</li>
        <li>The official Recruits logo, wordmarks, slogans, or taglines</li>
        <li>
          Any branding elements, fonts, or design motifs owned by the Recruits
          Project
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="heading">4. License Restrictions</h3>
      <p>You may not use the Licensed IP in any way that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Damages, disparages, or dilutes the Recruits brand or reputation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implies endorsement, sponsorship, or affiliation by the Team or any
          third party without prior written consent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Violates applicable laws, regulations, or the rights of any third
          party.
        </li>
        <li>
          Contains pornographic, defamatory, hateful, or otherwise objectionable
          content.
        </li>
        <li>
          Decisions about what constitutes brand‑damaging use are made at the
          Team’s sole discretion.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="heading">5. Transfer of License</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you sell, gift, or otherwise transfer your Recruits NFT, the
          license automatically transfers to the new owner.
        </li>
        <li>
          Upon transfer, your right to use the Licensed IP terminates
          immediately.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="heading">6. Approval & Brand Protection</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Prior Approval Required: For any large‑scale or public distribution of
          products or projects that incorporate your NFT’s likeness (especially
          if tangential to core Recruits branding), you must submit a
          description to the Team at therecruitsnft@gmail.com for review.
        </li>
        <li>
          Approval turnaround is typically within 5 business days. This process
          helps maintain consistent brand integrity.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="heading">7. Enforcement & Termination</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Team reserves the right to revoke your license and take legal
          action if you breach any of these Terms.
        </li>

        <li>
          License revocation is effective immediately upon written notice.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="heading">8. Amendments</h3>
      <p>
        These Terms may be updated at the Team’s discretion. Continued ownership
        or use of a Recruits NFT after changes are posted constitutes acceptance
        of the revised Terms.
